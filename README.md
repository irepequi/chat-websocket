This project is a real-time chat application using WebSocket. It allows users to send and receive messages instantly between each other without needing to reload the page.

## Features

âœ¨ **Real-time connection**: Messages are sent and received instantly without reloading the page, thanks to WebSocket.
ðŸ’¬ **Text messages**: Users can write and receive text messages in the chat.
ðŸ”’ **Secure connection**: Although this project uses an insecure WebSocket connection (`ws://`), it is recommended to use (`wss://`) for better security in a production environment.
